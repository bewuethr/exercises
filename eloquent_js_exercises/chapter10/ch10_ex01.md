### Module `villageGraph`

* Exports `buildGraph` and `runRobot`
* `roads` is just formatted in the way `buildGraph` needs it, but not part of the module
* `roadGraph` is an instance of a built graph, not internal to nodule
* Dependencies: module `robot`

### Module `robot`

* Exports `randomRobot`, `routeRobot` and `goalOrientedRobot`; maybe `mailRoute`
* `randomPick` and `findRoute` are internal
  * Both are very likely to be found as existing NPM modules
  * I would almost always prefer an NPM module over writing my own
